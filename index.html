		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="./assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
		<p>I'm an aspiring web developer located in the Chicago area. I've been dabbling into front end web dev specifically (HTML/CSS/JS) at the hobbyist level for both personal and work tasks for about a year.</p>

		<p>I use SQL (PostgreSQL) on a near daily basis for analysis and data reporting tasks at work. Related to this, I have also experimented with node.js for automating operational data reporting tasks, as well as maintaining existing Python scripts originally created by a former data scientist. Some of my favorite libraries have been jQuery, Underscore.js and C3.js for the front end, and Baby Parse for node.js projects.</p>

		<p>Outside of coding, one of my other great passions has been photography, primarily street photography. This goes hand-in-hand my other interest, international travel. I have spent time in France, China, Malaysia, Peru, Vietnam, and Nepal. My big to-do travel wise remain Mongolia and Kingdom of Bhutan.</p>
